## How to setup

Disclaimer: Use on your own risk and choose complex username & password in the below steps.

### **A) Enable webserver access in kodi**
1. In Kodi, go to *Settings* >> *Web server*
2. Set *Allow remote contorl via HTTP* to On
3. Choose a port number (e.g. 8080).
4. Choose a username and password (Important!)
5. Configure your router to forward the port you selected to your kodi device  
   _Note:_ Not needed if you decide to go with a local node webserver (B.2)
6. Find your external IP address (i.e. Google 'what's my ip?')

### **B) Set up a nodejs-webserver to control your kodi**
We currently support three methods of how this app can be hosted.
1. Hosting it in Glitch, a 3rd-party web-hosting service
2. Hosting it yourself
3. Hosting it yourself with Docker

The first method is very easy to set up and to maintain and also free of charge.
The second method is for advanced users. You have to setup and maintain the nodejs environment yourself. But it supports multiple Kodi instances, greatly reduces latency and does not expose your kodi-webservice to the internet directly.
The third method is also for advanced users. After installing docker, you can simply run our prebuilt docker images.

<details>
  <summary><b>B.1 Set up a webserver in Glitch</b> (Click to expand instructions)</summary><p />


1. Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and sign in with your github user
2. Create a new Glitch project and under *advance settings* choose *Import from GitHub*
3. Enter this project *OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi*
4. Change Glitch project settings to private (under *share* > *Make private*)
5. Edit the *.env* file in your Glitch project with the following settings:  (**see [this example](examples/env_file_example.png)**)


```ini
KODI_PROTOCOL="http"
KODI_IP="YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"
KODI_PORT="YOUR_KODI_PORT"
KODI_USER="YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME"
KODI_PASSWORD="YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD"
AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD"
```
*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD* can be anything you want.

6. Check your Glitch server address by choosing 'Show Live' on the top left. A new tab with your server will open. Note your server address in the address bar, you will need that later. We will refer to this address as _YOUR_NODE_SERVER_. (i.e. https://green-icecream.glitch.me)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>B.2 Set up local webserver</b> (Click to expand instructions)</summary><p />


1. Install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) application server on your target computer  
   _Note:_ Required Version is **6.10 or above** (8 preferred)
2. Choose a location, where your app will live (i.e `C:\node\`)
3. Clone this repo with git or simply download and unzip the sourcecode (green button on the top-right)
4. You now should have a folder with a bunch of files in it (i.e. here `C:\node\GoogleHomeKodi`)
5. Install this app
```batch
cd C:\node\GoogleHomeKodi
npm install
```
6. Create a copy of the `kodi-hosts.config.js.dist` file and name it `kodi-hosts.config.js`.
7. Edit the file and make sure the kodiConfig and globalConfig sections match your environment.
9. Set up your router to forward the port you just configured.  
   _Default:_ globalConfig.listenerPort: '8099'
8. You should now be able to start the node server by running: `node server.js`.
9. Find your external IP address (i.e. Google 'what's my ip?')  
   _Hint:_ It is strongly recommended to setup a dynDNS service of your choice. (i.e. selfhost.me)
10. The address of your self hosted node server now consists of the port of step 9 and the ip/host of step 10.  
    We will refer to this address later as _YOUR_NODE_SERVER_. (i.e. http://omertu.selfhost.me:8099)

_For Linux-Users only:_ Here is a systemd init config. To run it as a daemon.
On a debian dist save it as `/etc/systemd/system/kodiassistant.service`.
Don't forget to run: sudo systemctl enable `sudo systemctl enable kodiassistant.service` to start the deamon on startup.

```ini

  <summary><b>B.3 Set up local webserver using Docker</b> (Click to expand instructions)</summary><p />

As an alternative to (B.2), it's possible to use a pre-built [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sinedied/googlehomekodi/) to run a local instance.

You can use either *environment variables* or a `kodi-hosts.config.js` inside a folder mapped to the `/config` volume to configure your instance.

1. Install the Docker engine
   - If you want to run it on a LibreELEC system  
     You can simply install the offical service addon `Docker`
   - For all other systems please consult the offical documentation  
     [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
1. Download or build the docker image
   - For 64bit-Systems you can download out prebuilt docker-image
     ```
     docker pull sinedied/googlehomekodi
     ```
   - For all other systems you currently have to build the image yourself.
     - Clone this repo with git or simply download and unzip the sourcecode (green button on the top-right)
     - You now should have a folder with a bunch of files in it (i.e. here `C:\node\GoogleHomeKodi`)
     - Build the image
     ```
     cd C:\node\GoogleHomeKodi
     docker build -t sinedied/googlehomekodi .
     ```
2. Run the docker image
   - with the use of environment variables:
     ```sh
     docker run -d -p 8099:8099 \
                --restart always \
                -e KODI_PROTOCOL="http" \
                -e KODI_IP="YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS" \
                -e KODI_PORT="YOUR_KODI_PORT" \
                -e KODI_USER="YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME" \
                -e KODI_PASSWORD="YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD" \
                -e AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD" \
                --name googlehomekodi \
                sinedied/googlehomekodi
     ```
   - or with the use of the config file:
     - Create a copy of the `kodi-hosts.config.js.dist` file and name it `kodi-hosts.config.js`.
     - Edit the file and make sure the kodiConfig and globalConfig sections match your environment.
     - Run it  
       ```sh
       docker run -d -p 8099:8099 \
                  --restart always \
                  -v YOUR_CONFIG_DIR:/config \
                  --name googlehomekodi \
                  sinedied/googlehomekodi
       ```

3. In case you need to update to a newer version later, just repeat steps 2 and 3 after executing:
   ```
   docker stop googlehomekodi
   docker rm sinedied/googlehomekodi
   ```

### **C) [OPTIONAL] controlling multiple kodi instances**
There are two ways of implementing the scenario of multiple kodi instances (i.e one in the living room and another in the bedroom).
For both methods you will need two IFTTT-Applets with different phrases, due to the text-parameter limitation of IFTTT.
1. Having two node servers. Each targeting one instance. _(Recommended when hosting with glitch)_  
   i.e. the phrase `living room kodi play...` could target `https://mylivingroom.glitch.com/playpause`  
   and the phrase `bedroom kodi play...` could target `https://bedroom.glitch.com/playpause`.  
   - _Note:_ Behind a single external IP the kodi instances need still to be distinguishable.  
     This can be achieved in two ways:
     - Configuring both kodi instances with different ports  
       (i.e. _8080_ and _8090_)  
       _or_
     - Mapping with your routers port forwarding two different ports to the same port on different hosts  
       (i.e. _8080 -> 192.168.100.1:8080_ and 8090 -> 192.168.100.2:8080)
2. Having one node server targeting both kodi instances. _(Recommended when hosting yourself)_  
   The utilization of the _kodi-hosts.config.js_ allows you to name your instances and target them individually.  
   i.e. the phrase `living room kodi play...` could target `http://192.168.100.1:8080/playpause`  
   and the phrase `bedroom kodi play...` could target `http://192.168.100.2:8080/playpause`).

<details>
  <summary><b>C.2 utilize the kodi-hosts.config.js</b> (Click to expand instructions)</summary>

For this you will need to extend the list of configured kodi instances. Like in this example:

```javascript
exports.kodiConfig = [
  {
      id: 'kodi', // Give your main instance here any name you want
      // YOUR_KODI_PROTOCOL (http or https)
      kodiProtocol: 'http',
      // YOUR_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
      kodiIp: '192.168.178.10',
      // YOUR_KODI_PORT
      kodiPort: '8080',
      // YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME
      kodiUser: 'kodi',
      // YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD
      kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
  },
      // You can use this to specify additonal kodi installation, that you'd like to control.
      // For example alternate kodi destination 1:
  {
      id: 'bedroom',
      // YOUR_2ND_KODI_PROTOCOL (http or https)
      kodiProtocol: 'http',
      // YOUR_2ND_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
      kodiIp: '192.168.1.11',
      // YOUR_2ND_KODI_PORT
      kodiPort: '8080',
      // YOUR_2ND_KODI_USER_NAME
      kodiUser: 'kodi',
      // YOUR_2ND_KODI_PASSWORD
      kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
  },
      // You can use this to specify additonal kodi installation, that you'd like to control.
      // For example alternate kodi destination 2:
  {
      id: 'kitchen',
      // YOUR_3RD_KODI_PROTOCOL (http or https)
      kodiProtocol: 'http',
      // YOUR_3RD_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
      kodiIp: '192.168.1.12',
      // YOUR_3RD_KODI_PORT
      kodiPort: '8080',
      // YOUR_3RD_KODI_USER_NAME
      kodiUser: 'kodi',
      // YOUR_3RD_KODI_PASSWORD
      kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
  }
];
```

The `id` (a name you can choose freely) will match your kodi instance with a spoken keyword.
For every command / kodi destination you will need to add a new IFTTT applet.
The only difference is found in the `body`. As up until now you have been using a body only with a token attribute like: `{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*"}`.
Now you will need to add the `kodiid` attribute to it, matching the `id` of your configuration.

**Example scan library**
If you normally would use a sentence like: `"Hey Google, kodi scan library" --> Will start a full library scan`.
For running this command on your second kodi instance, you could copy the applet, and change it to:
`"Hey Google, kodi scan library in the bedroom"`.

In this new applet, you will need to make sure it will recognize this new sentence, and add the attribute `kodiid` to the body.
For example: `{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*", "kodiid":"bedroom"}`
</details>

### D) Set up IFTTT with your Google Home

1. Go to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)
2. Create a new applet: if *This* then *That*
3. For *This* choose: *Google Assistance*
    1. Choose *Say a phrase with a text ingredient*
    2. In *What do you want to say?* enter something like:
      > Kodi play movie $
    3. In *What do you want the Assistant to say in response?* enter something like:
      > ok playing $ movie
4. For *That* choose: *Maker Webhooks*
    1. Choose *Make a web request*
    2. In *URL* enter:
      >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playmovie?q={{TextField}}

    For example, if your node server address is 'green-icecream.glitch.me', your should enter:
      >https\://green-icecream.glitch.me/playmovie?q={{TextField}}

    8. Method: *POST*
    9. Content Type: *application/json*
    10. Body:
      >{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*"}

**Check out [this example](examples/IFTTT_settings_example.png) to make sure your settings are correct**


Now every time you say "Hey Google, Kodi play movie bla bla", it should play bla bla on your kodi.<br>
**Note:** If your external IP changes, this will stop working (consider getting a static IP address)


### Setting up other actions: ###

For **Tv show support - Next unwatched episode**, follow all the steps in **D**, except these changes:
  * Choose a different phrase (e.g. "Kodi play an episode of $")
  * Use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playtvshow?q={{TextField}}

For **Tv show support - Specific episode**, follow all the steps in **D**, except these changes:
  * Choose "*Say a phrase with both a number and a text ingredient*" in step 3
  * Choose a different phrase (e.g. "Kodi play $ episode #").


  For this to work, when you talk to your GoogleHome, the $ part must be in the format of *"[TV_SHOW_NAME] season [SEASON_NUMBER]"*. Meaning the word "Season" has to be said, the tv show name must be said before it and the season number must be said after it (i.e. "okay google kodi play bla season 4 episode 1")
  * Use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playepisode?q={{TextField}}&e={{NumberField}}

To **pause or resume** kodi follow the instructions in **D**, except these changes:
  * Choose "*Say a simple phrase*" in step 3
  * Use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playpause

To **Stop** kodi, follow the same instructions as *pause* but use this URL:
  >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/stop

To **Mute** kodi, follow the same instructions as *pause* but use this URL:
  >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/mute

To **Set Volume** on kodi use "Say a phrase with a number" and the URL:
  >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/volume?q={{NumberField}}

  To **Seek forward** by x minutes use "Say a phrase with a number" and the URL:
  >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/seekforwardminutes?q={{NumberField}}

For **PVR TV support - Set channel by name**, follow all the steps in **D**, except these changes:
  * Choose a different phrase (e.g. "switch kodi to $ channel")
  * Use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playpvrchannelbyname?q={{TextField}}

For **PVR TV support - Set channel by number**, use "Say a phrase with a number" and the URL:

  >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playpvrchannelbynumber?q={{NumberField}}

To **Start/resume a movie/tv episode with a delay**
  The commands marked with *delay (above) take an optional delay parameter to delay startup of the media by the specified number of seconds.

  For example:  
YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/playmovie?q=Deadpool&delay=10

To **Turn on/off the TV and switch Kodi's HDMI input**
  * This requires Kodi 17 (Krypton) and above
  * This also requires that both your kodi device and TV support CEC commands
  * You need to install [this script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec/raw/master/script.json-cec.zip) add-on: Download and move it to your kodi device and then in Kodi choose Settings>Add-ons>Install from zip file > choose the zip your just downloaded.
  * Finally you can use this in 2 ways:
    * Turn on: Add another command: follow the same instructions as *pause* but use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/activatetv

    *  If host your server on Glitch, add the following line to your .env file (see step B.1 - (5) above) and kodi will automaticly turn on the tv and switch the HDMI input everytime your trigger the main playing actions (play a move / tv show / episode / pvr channel)
    >ACTIVATE_TV="true"

    *  If you host your server yourself (see step B.2 - (7) above), then add the following line at the end of your kodi-hosts.config.js file instead
    >process.env['ACTIVATE_TV'] = 'true';

    * Turn off: Add another command: follow the same instructions as pause but use this URL:
    >_YOUR_NODE_SERVER_/standbytv

## Troubleshooting
If your can't preform a simple action like pausing a video, try to narrow down to problem:

1. While a video is being played in Kodi, try pausing it by entering this in your browser:
>http://YOUR_INTERNAL_KODI_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If you get prompt to enter username and password choose the ones you set in Kodi (step A above).
If that doesn't work, you probably have a problem with your kodi setup.

2. If that works, try pausing a video using your external IP:
>http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If that doesn't work you probably have a problem with your router configuration.

3. If it does work, there might be something wrong in your glich or IFTTT settings.
