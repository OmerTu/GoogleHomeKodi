## How to setup

Disclaimer: Use on your own risk and choose complex username & password in the below steps.

### **A) Enable webserver access in kodi**
1. In Kodi, go to *Settings* >> *Web server*
2. Set *Allow remote contorl via HTTP* to On
3. Choose a port number (e.g. 8080)
4. Choose a username and password (Important!)
5. Configure your router to forward the port your selected to your kodi device
6. Find your external IP address (i.e. Google 'what's my ip?')


### **B) Set up a webserver in Glitch to control your kodi**
1. Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and sign in with your github user
2. Create a new Glitch project and under *advance settings* choose *Import from GitHub*
3. Enter this project *OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi*
4. Change Glitch project settings to private (under *share* > *Make private*)
5. Edit the *.env* file in your Glitch project with the following settings:  (**see [this example](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi/develop/examples/env_file_example.png)**)


```
KODI_PROTOCOL="http"
KODI_IP="YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"
KODI_PORT="YOUR_KODI_PORT"
KODI_USER="YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME"
KODI_PASSWORD="YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD"
AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD"
```
*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD* can be anything you want.

6. Check your Glitch server address by choosing 'Show Live' on the top left. A new tab with your server will open. Note your server address in the address bar.

### **B.2) [OPTIONAL] Set up a local webserver to control your kodi**
As an alternative to (B), it's possible to run a local node.js server in stead of running it on Glitch.com. The benifit of this is that you don't need to expose your kodi Api.
Additional using the hodi-hosts.config.js file, you can set up and control multiple kodi installations.
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand (B.2) instructions</summary>

1. After cloning the repo, create a copy of the `kodi-hosts.config.js.dist` file and rename it to `kodi-hosts.config.js`.
2. Edit the file and make sure the kodiConfig and globalConfig sections match your environment.
3. You should now be able to start the node server by running: `node server.js`.

Here is a systemd init config. To run it as a daemon.
On a debian dist save it as `/etc/systemd/system/kodiassistant.service`.

Don't forget to run: sudo systemctl enable `sudo systemctl enable kodiassistant.service` to start the deamon on startup.

```
[Unit]
Description=Node.js Google Home Kodi Interface

SyslogIdentifier=nodejs-example

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Note: you server should run Node.js 6.10 or above (8 preferred)

</details>

### **B.3) [OPTIONAL] controlling multiple kodi instances**
Setting up the local node server, will allow you to utilize the kodi-hosts.config.js configuration.
This configuration will allow you to address multiple kodi installations (e.g. "Hey Google, kodi play [movie name] in the bedroom")

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand (B.3) instructions</summary>

For this you will need to extend the list. Like in this example:

```
exports.kodiConfig = [{
    id: 'kodi', // For now leave the first set to kodi.
    // YOUR_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL (http or https)
    kodiProtocol: 'http',
    // YOUR_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
    kodiIp: '192.168.178.10',
    // YOUR_KODI_PORT
    kodiPort: '8080',
    // YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME
    kodiUser: 'kodi',
    // YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD
    kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
},
    // You can use this to specify additonal kodi installation, that you'd like to control.
    // For example alternate kodi destination 1:   
{
    id: 'bedroom',
    // YOUR_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL (http or https)
    kodiProtocol: 'http',
    // YOUR_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
    kodiIp: '192.168.1.11',
    // YOUR_KODI_PORT
    kodiPort: '8080',
    // YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME
    kodiUser: 'kodi',
    // YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD
    kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
},
    // You can use this to specify additonal kodi installation, that you'd like to control.
    // For example alternate kodi destination 2:   
{
    id: 'kitchen',
    // YOUR_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL (http or https)
    kodiProtocol: 'http',
    // YOUR_KODI_IP_ADDRESS
    kodiIp: '192.168.1.12',
    // YOUR_KODI_PORT
    kodiPort: '8080',
    // YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME
    kodiUser: 'kodi',
    // YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD
    kodiPassword: 'myKodiPass'
}
];
```

The `id` will match your kodi instance with a spoken keyword.
For every command / kodi destination you will need to add a new IFTTT applet.
You'll only real change here, is the `body`. As up until now you have been using a body like: `{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*"}`.
Now you will need to add the `kodiid` attribute to it, matching the id of your configuration.

**Example scan library**
If you normally would use a sentence like: `"Hey Google, kodi scan library" --> Will start a full library scan`.
For running this command on your second kodi instance, you could copy the applet, and change it to:
`"Hey Google, kodi scan library in the bedroom"`.

In this new applet, you will need to make sure it will recognize this new sentence, and add the attribute `kodiid` to the body.
For example: `{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*", "kodiid":"bedroom"}`
</details>


### **B.4) [OPTIONAL] Set up a local instance using Docker**
As an alternative to (B.2), it's possible to use a pre-built [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sinedied/googlehomekodi/) to run a local instance.

You can use either *environment variables* or a `kodi-hosts.config.js` inside a folder mapped to the `/config` volume to configure your instance.
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand (B.4) instructions</summary>

The following steps assume that you already have a working Docker setup on your machine.

1. `docker pull sinedied/googlehomekodi`
2. To use with environment variables:
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 8099:8099 \
              -e KODI_PROTOCOL="http" \
              -e KODI_IP="YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS" \
              -e KODI_PORT="YOUR_KODI_PORT" \
              -e KODI_USER="YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME" \
              -e KODI_PASSWORD="YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD" \
              -e AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD" \
              --name googlehomekodi sinedied/googlehomekodi
   ```
   Alternatively, you can create a copy of the `kodi-hosts.config.js.dist` file, rename it to `kodi-hosts.config.js` and place it in a folder, then:
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 8099:8099 \
              -v YOUR_CONFIG_DIR:/config \
              --name googlehomekodi sinedied/googlehomekodi
   ```

That's all!
</details>

### C) Set up IFTTT with your Google Home

1. Go to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)
2. Create a new applet: if *This* then *That*
3. For *This* choose: *Google Assistance*
    1. Choose *Say a phrase with a text ingredient*
    2. In *What do you want to say?* enter something like:
      > Kodi play movie $
    3. In *What do you want the Assistant to say in response?* enter something like:
      > ok playing $ movie
4. For *That* choose: *Maker Webhooks*
    1. Choose *Make a web request*
    2. In *URL* enter:
      >YOUR_GLITCH_SERVER_ADDRESS/playmovie?q= {{TextField}}
    
    For example, if your glitch server address is 'green-icecream.glitch.me', your should enter:
      >https://green-icecream.glitch.me/playmovie?q= {{TextField}}
    
    8. Method: *POST*
    9. Content Type: *application/json*
    10. Body:
      >{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*"}

**Check out [this example](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi/develop/examples/IFTTT_settings_example.png) to make sure your settings are correct**


Now every time you say "Hey Google, Kodi play movie bla bla", it should play bla bla on your kodi.<br>
**Note:** If your external IP changes, this will stop working (consider getting a static IP address)

To **Turn on the TV and switch to Kodi's HDMI input** 
  * This requires Kodi 17 (Krypton) and above
  * This also requires that both your kodi device and TV support CEC commands
  * You need to install [this script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec/raw/master/script.json-cec.zip) add-on: Download and move it to your kodi device and then in Kodi choose Settings>Add-ons>Install from zip file > choose the zip your just downloaded.
  * Finally you can use this in 2 ways:
    * Add another command: follow the same instructions as *pause* but use this URL:
    >YOUR_GLITCH_SERVER_ADDRESS/activatetv
    
    *  Add the following line to your .env file (see step B-5 above) and kodi will automaticly turn on the tv and switch the HDMI input everytime your trigger the main playing actions (play a move / tv show / episode / pvr channel)
    >ACTIVATE_TV="true"

## Troubleshooting
If your can't preform a simple action like pausing a video, try to narrow down to problem:

1. While a video is being played in Kodi, try pausing it by entering this in your browser:
>http://YOUR_INTERNAL_KODI_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If you get prompt to enter username and password choose the ones you set in Kodi (step A above).
If that doesn't work, you probably have a problem with your kodi setup.

2. If that works, try pausing a video using your external IP:
>http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If that doesn't work you probably have a problem with your router configuration.

3. If it does work, there might be something wrong in your glich or IFTTT settings.
