## How to setup

Disclaimer: Use on your own risk and choose complex username & password in the below steps.

### **A) Enable webserver access in kodi**
1. In Kodi, go to *Settings* >> *Web server*
2. Set *Allow remote contorl via HTTP* to On
3. Choose a port number (e.g. 8080)
4. Choose a username and password (Important!)
5. Configure your router to forward the port your selected to your kodi device
6. Find your external IP address (i.e. Google 'what's my ip?')


### **B) Set up a webserver in Glitch to control your kodi**
1. Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and sign in with your github user
2. Create a new Glitch project and under *advance settings* choose *Import from GitHub*
3. Enter this project *OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi*
4. Change Glitch project settings to private (under *share* > *Make private*)
5. Edit the *.env* file in your Glitch project with the following settings:
```
KODI_IP="YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"
KODI_PORT="YOUR_KODI_PORT"
KODI_USER="YOUR_KODI_USER_NAME"
KODI_PASSWORD="YOUR_KODI_PASSWORD"
AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD"
```
*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD* can be anything you want.

6. Check your Glitch server address by choosing 'Show Live' on the top left. A new tab with your server will open. Note your server address in the address bar.

### **B.2) [OPTIONAL] Set up a local webserver to control your kodi**
As an alternative to (B), it's possible to run a local node.js server in stead of running it on Glitch.com. The benifit of this is that you don't need to expose your kodi Api.
Additional using the hodi-hosts.config.js file, you can set up and control multiple kodi installations.
1. After cloning the repo, create a copy of the `kodi-hosts.config.js.dist` file and rename it to `kodi-hosts.config.js`.
2. Edit the file and make sure the kodiConfig and globalConfig sections match your environment.
3. You should now be able to start the node server by running: `node server.js`.

Here is a systemd init config. To run it as a daemon.
On a debian dist save it as `/etc/systemd/system/kodiassistant.service`.

Don't forget to run: sudo systemctl enable `sudo systemctl enable kodiassistant.service` to start the deamon on startup.

```
[Unit]
Description=Node.js Google Home Kodi Interface

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /opt/GoogleHomeKodi/server.js
# Required on some systems
WorkingDirectory=/opt/GoogleHomeKodi
Restart=always
# Restart service after 10 seconds if node service crashes
RestartSec=10
# Output to syslog
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=nodejs-example

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


### C) Set up IFTTT with your Google Home

1. Go to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)
2. Create a new applet: if *This* then *That*
3. For *This* choose: *Google Assistance*
    1. Choose *Say a phrase with a text ingredient*
    2. In *What do you want to say?* enter something like:
      > Kodi play $
    3. In *What do you want the Assistant to say in response?* enter something like:
      > ok playing $ movie
4. For *That* choose: *Maker Webhooks*
    1. Choose *Make a web request*
    2. In *URL* enter:
      >YOUR_GLITCH_SERVER_ADDRESS/playmovie?q= {{TextField}}
    
    For example, if your glitch server address is 'green-icecream.glitch.me', your should enter:
      >https://green-icecream.glitch.me/playmovie?q= {{TextField}}
    
    8. Method: *POST*
    9. Content Type: *application/json*
    10. Body:
      >{"token":"*YOUR_CONNECTION_PASSWORD*"}



Now every time you say "Hey Google, Kodi play movie bla bla", it should play bla bla on your kodi.

**Note:** If your external IP changes, this will stop working (consider getting a static IP address)


### Setting up other actions: ###

For **Tv show support - Next unwatched episode**, follow all the steps in **C**, except these changes:

To **Turn on the TV and switch to Kodi's HDMI input** 
  * This requires Kodi 17 (Krypton) and above
  * This also requires that both your kodi device and TV support CEC commands
  * You need to install [this script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec/raw/master/script.json-cec.zip) add-on: Download and move it to your kodi device and then in Kodi choose Settings>Add-ons>Install from zip file > choose the zip your just downloaded.
  * Finally you can use this in 2 ways:
    * Add another command: follow the same instructions as *pause* but use this URL:
    >YOUR_GLITCH_SERVER_ADDRESS/activatetv
    
    *  Add the following line to your .env file (see step B-5 above) and kodi will automaticly turn on the tv and switch the HDMI input everytime your trigger the main playing actions (play a move / tv show / episode / pvr channel)
    >ACTIVATE_TV="true"

## How to update to the latest version
1. Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) and sign in with your github user
2. Select your Glitch project and under *advance settings* choose *Import from GitHub*
3. Enter this project *OmerTu/GoogleHomeKodi*

------------
## Troubleshooting
If your can't preform a simple action like pausing a video, try to narrow down to problem:

1. While a video is being played in Kodi, try pausing it by entering this in your browser:
>http://YOUR_INTERNAL_KODI_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If you get prompt to enter username and password choose the ones you set in Kodi (step A above).
If that doesn't work, you probably have a problem with your kodi setup.

2. If that works, try pausing a video using your external IP:
>http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP:PORT/jsonrpc?request={"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"Player.playpause","params":{"playerid":1}}

If that doesn't work you probably have a problem with your router configuration.

3. If it does work, there might be something wrong in your glich or IFTTT settings.
